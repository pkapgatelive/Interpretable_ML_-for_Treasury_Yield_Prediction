        "This notebook explores the yield curve data and macroeconomic indicators that will be used for forecasting. It provides an initial understanding of the data structure, quality, and key patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "1. **Load and examine yield curve data** from various sources (FRED, Treasury, Bloomberg)\n",
        "2. **Analyze data quality** - missing values, outliers, data gaps\n",
        "3. **Explore yield curve dynamics** - level, slope, curvature patterns\n",
        "4. **Examine macroeconomic relationships** with yield curve movements\n",
        "5. **Generate summary statistics** and initial visualizations\n",
        "6. **Identify data preprocessing requirements** for modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "## Expected Outputs\n",
        "- Data quality assessment report\n",
        "- Yield curve visualization over time\n",
        "- Correlation analysis between tenors\n",
        "- Macro indicators vs yield relationships\n",
        "- Data preprocessing recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dependencies\n",
        "- Raw yield curve data (to be loaded from sources)\n",
        "- Macroeconomic indicators data\n",
        "- Configuration files (config/config.yaml)\n"
